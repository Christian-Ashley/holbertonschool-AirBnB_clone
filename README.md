# holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone

Purpose
This projects objectives were to create a functioning command line interpreter for the use of manipulating objects within the AirBnB clone project. The goals were to learn how to make a python package, use modules to create a CLI(command line interpreter), use unit testing, serialize and deserialize a class, write and read a JSON file. use datetime and UUID modules, handle *args and kwargs, and handle named arguments in the function.

Requirements 
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

Examples of how to use the console

The console can be used in an interactive or non interactive mode.

running ./console.py will open a prompt the user can call functions from
    	$ ./console.py
	(hbnb) help

	Documented commands (type help <topic>):
	========================================
	EOF  help  quit

	(hbnb) 
	(hbnb) 
	(hbnb) quit
	$

 to exit the console you simply press Ctrl+D
